class ATSimulator(object):
    """A centralised class which makes use of AT to simulate the physics data
    for the copy of the AT lattice which it holds. It works as follows, when a
    change is made to the lattice in Pytac it is added to the queue attribute
    of this class. When the queue has changes on it  a recalculation is
    triggered, all the changes are applied to the lattice and then the physics
    data calculated. This ensures that the physics data is up to date.

    **Attributes**

    Attributes:
        queue (cothread.EventQueue): A queue of changes to be made to the
                                      lattice on the next recalculation cycle.
        up_to_date (cothread.Event): A flag that indicates if the physics data
                                      is up to date with all the changes made
                                      to the AT lattice.

    .. Private Attributes:
           _at_lat (at.lattice_object.Lattice): The centralised instance of an
                                                 AT lattice from which the
                                                 physics data is calculated.
           _rp (numpy.array): A boolean array to be used as refpts for the
                               physics calculations.
           _emittance (tuple): Emittance, the output of the AT physics function
                                ohmi_envelope (see at.lattice.radiation.py).
           _lindata (tuple): Linear optics data, the output of the AT physics
                              function linopt (see at.lattice.linear.py).
           _paused (cothread.Event): A flag used to temporarily pause the
                                      physics calculations.
           _calculation_thread (cothread.Thread): A thread to check the queue
                                                    for new changes to the AT
