ATIP - Accelerator Toolbox Interface for Pytac
==============================================

ATIP is intended to integrate a simulator, using the python implementation of
`AT <https://github.com/atcollab/at>`_ (pyAT), into
`Pytac <https://github.com/dls-controls/pytac>`_ so that it can be addressed
in the same manner as the live machine.
